Handling the manifest.json file is crucial as it defines various properties and permissions for your extension. Here's a breakdown of what each part means:Let's go through each part:

manifest_version: This indicates the version of the manifest file. In this case, it's version 3.
name: The name of your extension. This is what users will see in their browser.
version: The version of your extension. Increment this when you release updates.
description: A brief description of what your extension does.
permissions: This lists the permissions your extension requires. In this example, it requires access to local storage and active tabs.
storage: Allows the extension to use the Chrome Storage API to store data locally.
activeTab: Allows the extension to access the currently active tab.
background: This section defines a background script (service worker) that runs in the background and manages events.
service_worker: Specifies the JavaScript file that will serve as the background script (background.js in this case).
content_scripts: This section defines scripts that will run in the context of web pages.
matches: URLs that the content script should run on. <all_urls> matches all URLs.
js: JavaScript files that will be injected into the matched pages (content.js in this case).
action: This section defines the extension's browser action, typically an icon in the browser toolbar.
default_popup: Specifies the HTML file that will be displayed when the user clicks the extension icon (popup.html in this case).
default_icon: Specifies icons for different sizes.
icons: This section specifies the icons used by the extension in various sizes.
Once you've set up your manifest.json, ensure that all the referenced files (e.g., background.js, content.js, popup.html, popup.js, and icon images) exist in your extension directory. Also, make sure the paths specified in the manifest.json match the actual file locations.
